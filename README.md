# Autonomous Vehicle Project
This is a project created by the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs Autonomous Vehicle Team.
We have worked on this code sense September 2016. If you have any questions regarding the code. We will continuously update the Wiki page and if you notice any issues with the code, please make an issue.

This code uses the Arduino Framework and should work on all Arduino based micro controllers(as long as they have enough space).

##What our team uses
